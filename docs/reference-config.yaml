# This file documents all the available config options and it's default values.
#
# All config options can be configured via environment variables as well.
# If you specify both the env variable and yaml option for the same configuration
# the environment variable will take precedence. If you want to use a YAML config
# file, specify the path to the config file by setting the env variable
# CONFIG_FILEPATH.
#
# The env variable name is auto generated by upper casing everything and adding
# an underscore for each indentation/level. Some examples:
# kafka.rackId => KAFKA_RACKID
# kafka.tls.caFilepath => KAFKA_TLS_CAFILEPATH
# minion.consumerGroups.allowedGroups => MINION_CONSUMERGROUPS_ALLOWEDGROUPS
#
# Env variables that expect array values can be provided by separting them using
# a comma: KAFKA_BROKERS = "broker1:9092,broker2:9092,broker3:9092"
